Hey girl, it was a rainy Thursday
Your tears, were drops of morning rain
You cried, I couldn’t find the answer
But now I want to return

Long, long, long time ago
It used to be the world
Where we had somethig more
Long, long, long time ago
It used to be the world
Where we had something more
I was happy, now I’m drained

Hey time, why do you run away now
The fall will never come again
Hey girl, although today is Sunday
I want to see the rain

Long, long, long time ago
It used to be the world
Where we had somethig more
Long, long, long time ago
It used to be the world
Where we had something more
I was happy, now I’m drained.
