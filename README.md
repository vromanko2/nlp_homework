I've used C-Support Vector Classification and RandomForestClassifier.
I would say that they both worked well, but Random forest has better result, than C-Support Vector Classification. 
Random forest - Accuracy :  0.9545454545454546
C-Support Vector Classification - Accuracy :  0.9428571428571428
If i had more time I would try more classifications and compare the result.
